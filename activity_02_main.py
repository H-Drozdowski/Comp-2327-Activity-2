    # 1. Declare variable that would store a list of Shape objects.

    # Append the Rectangle to the list of shapes.


    # 4. Code 3 additional statements which creates an instance of 
    # Triangle or Rectangle classes (your choice).
    # Append these instances to the list of shapes.


    # 5. Iterate through the list of shapes.  
    # On each iteration:
    # - Print the string representation of the shape.
    # - Print the area of the shape to 2 decimal places.
    # - Print the perimeter of the shape to 2 decimal places.
