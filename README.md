## Additional Information

Components of module 2 I used in this assignment
- abstract methods: Created two abstract methods in the Shape class and overwrote them in its sub classes.
- Class Inheritance: Created the Shapes super class and had two sub classes (Rectangle & Triangle) inheriting from it.
- Abstract Class: Created the abstract Shape class with two abstract methods. 
- Polymorphism: Used a list of shapes to call the two abstract methods from the super class on the two subclasses.
